# DepositFree Soroban Contracts

DepositFree is a stablecoin loss protection protocol for Stellar/Soroban. This workspace contains only smart contracts and tests; it does not include frontend, backend, AI, tenant, rental, or mock dashboard logic.

## Contracts

- `protection_engine`: Main user-facing contract. It creates protection positions, calculates fees, locks reserve capacity, checks oracle prices, triggers claims, expires positions, and coordinates principal and payout withdrawals.
- `protected_balance_vault`: Holds protected principal by position ID. Only the configured protection engine can instruct deposits and withdrawals.
- `premium_vault`: Collects non-refundable protection fees from users and forwards them to the reserve vault.
- `reserve_vault`: Holds reserve liquidity, accepts deposits, locks maximum payout capacity for active positions, releases unused capacity, and pays claims.
- `oracle_adapter`: Stores scaled stablecoin prices set by the configured admin/oracle source.

## Money Flow

For a user protecting `1000` units with a `1%` fee and a `10%` max payout cap:

1. The user calls `protection_engine.create_position`.
2. `1000` principal moves from the user to `protected_balance_vault`.
3. `10` fee moves from the user to `premium_vault`.
4. `premium_vault` forwards the fee token balance to `reserve_vault`.
5. `reserve_vault` records the premium deposit and locks the maximum payout capacity, for example `100`.
6. The position is stored as `Active`.

Prices use 8-decimal scaling:

```txt
1.00 = 100_000_000
0.98 = 98_000_000
0.94 = 94_000_000
```

If the oracle price drops below the user trigger before expiry:

```txt
payout = protected_amount * (100_000_000 - current_price) / 100_000_000
final_payout = min(payout, protected_amount * max_payout_bps / 10_000)
```

The user can claim the reserve payout and withdraw the original principal. If no trigger happens before expiry, the position expires, locked capacity is released, and the user can withdraw principal only.

## Interaction Order

1. Deploy/register all five contracts.
2. Initialize `protection_engine` with admin and all vault/oracle addresses.
3. Initialize `protected_balance_vault` with admin and engine address.
4. Initialize `reserve_vault` with admin and engine address.
5. Initialize `premium_vault` with admin, engine address, and reserve vault address.
6. Initialize `oracle_adapter` with admin.
7. Admin funds `reserve_vault.deposit_reserve`.
8. Admin/oracle sets initial price through `oracle_adapter.set_price`.
9. Users create protection with `protection_engine.create_position`.
10. Anyone can call `check_and_trigger` while the position is active and unexpired.
11. Users claim payouts and/or withdraw principal through `protection_engine`.

## Running Tests

From this folder:

```powershell
cargo test
```

If Windows Application Control blocks build scripts in the workspace target directory, clean the old build outputs after updating Rust and retry:

```powershell
cargo clean
cargo test
```

If your machine still blocks generated build scripts, run the same command from a developer-trusted folder or allow the generated Rust build-script binaries in Windows Security / App Control. The contracts themselves do not require deployment to run unit tests.

## Building Contracts

Install the Stellar/Soroban CLI for your local toolchain, then build the workspace:

```powershell
rustup target add wasm32v1-none
cargo build --release --target wasm32v1-none
```

Or build one contract at a time:

```powershell
cargo build -p protection_engine --release --target wasm32v1-none
cargo build -p protected_balance_vault --release --target wasm32v1-none
cargo build -p premium_vault --release --target wasm32v1-none
cargo build -p reserve_vault --release --target wasm32v1-none
cargo build -p oracle_adapter --release --target wasm32v1-none
```

No deployment is performed by this repository.
